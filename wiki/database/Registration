Registration is now online and will be closed on *March 15th* Japanese time.

=== Speakers

Speakers that were accepted for the conference don't need to pay the registration fee for the conference.

=== Japanese Resident

Japanese resident attendees need to buy the tickets online from [http://www2.lawsonticket.com/pc/P40/WM80.asp?SI=yap Lawson Ticket].

=== International Attendees

Attendees flying from the oversea won't have an access to the online ticket payment system, so we have a special [http://shibuya.pm.org/register/yapc-register/ web form] that you can pay via PayPal. You can also pay at the venue, in which case the registration fee would increase a little (500 JPY).
