We plan to make S, M, L and XL size T-shirts. They'll be based on Japanese standard, so think that XL means LL in U.S. standard :) We'll have only limited # of shirts available for some sizes, and chances are you can't get the best-fit size. Thanks for your understanding.

No, you don't need to register for each session. If you register the conference, or have a paper ticket for the conference, you can attend to any sessions.
