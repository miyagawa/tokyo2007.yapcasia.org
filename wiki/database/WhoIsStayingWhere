JonathanRockway - Toyoko Inn (Shinjuku) from the evening of Sunday, April 1st to April 8th.  On non-conference days I'll be attempting to bankrupt JR with clever use of my unlimited JR Rail Pass (i.e. travelling).  Anyone that wants to come with, let me know.  

TatsuhikoMiyagawa - I will arrive at Narita on April 2nd, 3:10pm. I know it's a very last minute as an organizer :) I will stay at my own apartment in Tokyo and will leave for Taipei to attend to [http://osdc.tw/ OSDC.tw] on 13th evening.
