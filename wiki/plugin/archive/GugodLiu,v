I'm a freelancer living a small city called "Jhubei" in Taiwan, also the founder of [Chupei.pm http://chupei.pm.org/] (Chupei is the old official pinying of Jhubei.) I also started a cafe in Hsin-chu city called [OPCafé http://opcafe.net], and mostly stay there trying to be creative and productive. I have several nice ideas and projects to do, and many blogs (some of them have many co-authors) with all different purposes.
