NOTE TO TRANSLATORS:

The slide manuscript is in the "Attachments" section of this page.

I am going to run this through my slide-generating software when I am done.
To make this easy on me, please change something like this:

.pre
#SECTION#

Parsing 
*******

* _Parsing_ is the process of taking an unstructured input

  * Such as a sequence of characters

* and turning it into a data structure
.pre

To something like this:

.pre
#SECTION#

#J#  構文解析とは

Parsing 
*******

#J#  構文解析というのは構造化されていない入力、

* _Parsing_ is the process of taking an unstructured input

#J#  つまり、たとえばただの文字列とかを

  * Such as a sequence of characters

#J#  構造化されたデータ、

* and turning it into a data structure
.pre


* Text in [[double brackets]] is typewriter font
* Text in _underscores_ is italics
* Text in *stars* is boldface
* #lines that begin with hash signs are processing directives
