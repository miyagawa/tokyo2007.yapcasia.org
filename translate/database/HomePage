== !YAPC::Asia 2007 Translators Wiki

This wiki was setup with the objective for us Japanese volunraty !YAPC::Asia translators to collaborate on translating English talks so that we can make most of the talks easier for attendees to understand.

== How-To

Speakers: paste your manuscript (slides text portion) as plain text on the Wiki page. Include the format you'd like translators to annotate.

Translators: [http://tokyo2007.yapcasia.org/translate/index.cgi?action=user_preferences Set your username first] and edit the manuscript to add Japanese translation. You're welcome to fix someone else's mistakes.

To avoid duplicate efforts, announce on speakers mailing list before starting to translate the whole talk. Or you can update the Wiki page adding "Translator: your name (working)" on the top.

!!! Kwiki doesn't have an auto-save feature and if there's a conflict your edit may be lost without actually saving it. *Always use Firefox or your offline text editor to edit the translation* !!!
